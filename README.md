# *sebatibot*

*sebatibot* is a Telegram bot (written in Go) *slash* brainchild of me and my **#1 favorite person in the world, [@mlsaito](https://github.com/mlsaito).** I won't go saying this is meant to be innovative or that *sebatibot* can do stuff you've never seen before because, honestly, as of writing, *sebatibot* is simply a project Mako and I *(plan to)* bond over during the weekends (aside from *__Monster Hunter: World__* and other stuff).

## Say, what does *sebatibot* do?

Nothing much at the moment :lmao: but here's our *partial* list:
- **remind**s you:

  > remind me to go to the bank and pay my credit card later at 3:30pm

  where *sebatibot* will respond and tell you

  > I will remind you to “go to the bank and pay my credit card later” at 3:30PM today.

- says **hello** to you!

  > hi sebatibot!

  and *sebatibot* will then say

  > hello!
